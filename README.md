# PyHance
## Introduction
PyHance is a Python extension that adds additional functionality to built-in data types and more.
Some of the things PyHance does are:
* Adds a `range_()` function which adds the option for an inclusive range
* Adds a  `haversine()` function which enables the calculation of distance between two points
* Adds the option to index into a custom `dictionary` class using:
    * `key_at()` method for finding a key by index
    * `value_at()` method for finding a value by index
    * `item_at()` method for finding a key-value pair by index
* Adds a `remove` method to a custom `string` class to remove an item from the string

## Contributing
To contribute to PyHance (which is welcome and appreciated), create an issue with your idea/bug fix. If it's a bug fix, I'll try to reproduce the bug on replit.com. If I can reproduce it, I will gladly work with you (or you can make a pull request on your own) to fix the bug! If it's a feature request, I'll review the requested feature and how it will fit in with the rest of PyHance. If it will make Python easier or more joyful to use, I'll gladly implement the feature! 

### Creating a bug report issue/pull request
To create an issue/pull request about a bug, please use the issue/pull request template for bugs, and include detailed steps on how to reproduce the bug. If you are creating a pull request, make sure that your code doesn't break any other parts of PyHance. I will format the code to yapf standards with no configurations after the bug is fixed.
