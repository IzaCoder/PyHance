# PyHance
## Introduction
PyHance is a Python extension that adds additional functionality to built-in data types and more.
Some of the things PyHance does are:
* Adds a `range_()` function which adds the option for an inclusive range
* Adds a  `haversine()` function which enables the calculation of distance between two points
* Adds the option to index into a custom `dictionary` class using:
    * `key_at()` method for finding a key by index
    * `value_at()` method for finding a value by index
    * `item_at()` method for finding a key-value pair by index
* Adds a `remove` method to a custom `string` class to remove an item from the string
