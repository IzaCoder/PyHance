## Reporting a Vulnerability

### When to report
Please report a vulnerability *after* checking that no one else has reported it, and after doing *just a little bit* of research to ensure that we're using the same version that the vulnerability was found in (if the vulnerability is in an external library), and that the vulnerability hasn't already been fixed.

### What to report
It will make it easier for us if your report conforms to the following structure.

1. What file did you find it in?
2. Is the vulnerability in an external library?
3. If so, what library is it?
4. If it's internal, what technology has the vulnerability?
5. Do you have any suggestions on how to fix it?

### What tags to add
Please add the *vulnerability* and *filename* tags to your report, with *filename* being the name of the file that the vulnerability was found in.

### How to report
Create an issue with the title "Security Vulnerability", and add the tags listed in the *What tags to add* section.

### When you'll get a response
Someone will normally respond within 2 days, but sometimes life happens and no one can respond within that time frame. We're doing our best to ensure that all issues are acknowledged quickly.
