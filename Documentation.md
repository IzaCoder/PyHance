# PyHance Documentation

## Welcome to PyHance
Welcome to PyHance and thank you for looking at this project!
Now, you may be wondering, what does PyHance do?
PyHance:
* Adds functionality to builtin data types (such as adding a `remove()` method to a custom `string` class)
* Adds new functions (such as a new `range` function that adds an option to be inclusive)

## Classes
### dictionary
The `dictionary` class is an extension of the builtin `dict` class.
